0,"This device doesnt need any review as there are tons online , but as per my experience its all rounder champ. I bought 256 gb variant. All good till now.Just bit spectacular about the software updates if apple deliberately tries to downgrade the experience and camera quality.Camera quality:I felt iphone 14 gets better result not sure why? Although both device have same camera specs , is apple doing something fishy?Battery:Is decent ,usually lasts for a day."
1,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using Samsung S10 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customization is really good and you can customize a lot of things."

3,I am moving from Android to ios for the first time. It is been a marvelous experience to use iPhone. I regret now for being an android user. First of all the speed what they have mentioned as lightening speed yes i have experienced the lightening speed. Anything u share in whatsapp or any app u open it opens up in a flash. When I put the phone on charging it sometimes over heat the phone but now i have identified the reason for it too. Do not use the phone When on charging leave it untouched so that it won't over heat. No sort of pauses aur hanging issues at all.
4,"here's my verdict after the iOS 17.1.2 update.* horrible battery life, i end up charging twice a day* camera app freezes in when portrait mode is opened* Phone is much more laggy since the iOS 17 update.* IG reels play in the background at times, even when looking at another reel.* My battery health has dropped from 99% to 91% since the iOS 17 update.* What made the battery life worse was the magsafe charger. If you don't have it yet, don't buy it as it is a  slow charger (for overnight charging) and generates a lot of heat when charging, i ended up buying an  aluminium stand so that the heat would dissipate through the stand.If a company forces you to buy several other products for the customer to use it for its intended purpose, then please choose another device.Westerners don't have to worry about it as they have apple care + clubbed into their purchase in the form of an EMI. Plus , they have theft protection with their apple care + which is not available for the iPhones sold in India.Do not buy an iPhone if its just a status symbol for you, buy it if it suits your needs."

9,"It was my transition from android to IOS and to be honest, I have loved this iPhone. The UI is smooth, the transitions are nice and the battery also lasts for a day almost. I recommend everyone to go for it. The only thing which bothers me is that it doesn't have 120 Hz display BUT you will not feel it frequently, it is really smooth."
