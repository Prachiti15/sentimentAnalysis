11,"¬†The keyboard quality is decent and this was the heaviest one on my list. RBG lighting is also good with many modes. The cable is long enough and of good quality. Typing experience is good.However the keys are little wobbly and have a slight squeak sound when pressed at a weird angle. Key cap markings are not the best with some(like &, B) clipped off a bit on top and bottom.Overall really good mechanical keyboard under ‚Çπ2.5k.üôå Cosmic Byte good jobüëç"
