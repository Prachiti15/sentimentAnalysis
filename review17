2,"¬†model : cb-gk-28 (otemu red hotswappable upgraded) aka vanthThere is a lot to talk about this keyboard so I would try to keep sentences short and to the point.TLDR - Basic Overview of my review : I like the Keyboard very much considering the feature set it is offering vs the price it is available at. So overall a highly recommended keyboard for beginners or even intermediates. Just don't expect any brand support as they clearly dont acknowledge any QA. And keep the price in mind. More in detail below.pros :-1. Price - Absolute Value for money. This is cheapest mechanical keyboard with all the features enlisted compared to any other brand. My order was 1749‚Çπ for referene.2. Backlight - Easy to type in low light or night time without a room light , in short night time usage without disturbing people around.3. Sound - The otemu red switches (claimed in product description) are very nice low sounding more towards Thock sound pattern which will not disturb anyone around.4. Size - Full size keyboard , no compromise in numpad, or the home keys. The arrow keys are also full sized.5. N key rollover - by default this does not function out of the box. But it exists. Use any keyboard tester website of your choice to check if your keyboard has 6 key limit. if so press Fn+ScrLk (function and scroll lock) to toggle n key rollover on or off based on your preference and use case if needed.6. Win Key Lock - Although windows can still spoil your gaming experience or any other experience by slappign you popups anytime (those system popups about update or any other things), but still Win key being close to Ctrl and Shift is usually accidentally pressed and thus loosing focus of your active game/application window resulting in missing that perfect headshot. Any ways you can lock Win key to prevent this using Fn+Win combination.7. Full keyboard Lock - can be used when cleaning your keyabord or when trying to grab your keybaord and move or reposition or from any other accidental keypresses.8. Hot Swappable - yes the keys are hot swappable and are 3 pin configuration so if you are plannign to use 5 pin ones you need to chop the extras but still be able to use or swap keys.9. Media keys and other utils like calculator, search, explorer(my computer), msuic player and play/pause stop rewind and forward along with volume mute, increase and decrease shortcuts are mapped in F keys row to be used with Fn key.Now lets talk about the devil's side :cons :-1. RGB back lighting - the lights as marketed are not RGB lighting, god knows when manufacturers will stop misleading usign such marketing terms. The lights are fixed and mixed for each row. From top starting from red moving to yellow and then green towards blue at the end rows as seen in the images. This is not, I repeat NOT an RGB keyboard. Its just misleading. With this comment I would like to also point this to the manufacturer to stop misleading people. Your product is already good in its own respect, don't spoil it with such cheap marketing. yes it does have some effects built in and you need to choose from them only. Thats a bummer.2. user manual - The user manual is a piece of paper folded in to sides with some information but mostly inaccurate and with mistakes. We confirmed this from the customer care over email communication as well as telephonic conversation that yes they are mistakes and misprints in user manual. discussed about error in explanations below as we reach that point about indicator led, locking keyboard, customer care etc experience below.3. no software control - at this price you should not expect this but still there is no control over the keyboard using any software or any GUI based method. no per key rgbgb since its not an RGB keyboard, its fixed led pattern keyboard.4. indicator led - we contacted customer care to report that manual says windows lock indicator light however there was none and said it was mistake in user manual, okay but then you post the mistaken data in product catalog and everywhere else. The same data is everywhere in the product details section. Here comes a TWIST. Actually when you do a windows lock , there is a slight change in light, it bleeds through other indicator lights as shown in the video posted along this review. They just forgot to put a hole in the shell to let that led poke through is my assumption since I have not dis assembled the keyboard yet to verify. However the customer care response after reporting this acknowledges that this is normal behavious and is in all of their models(they emailed reply saying in reposnse to our complaint confirming this) thus they know this is a faulty behavior and irony is they say it is meant to be like this and is not a defect in the product.5. lock keys - there are two different type of lock. One is to lock the complete keyboard and other is to lock Win key only. but there is no mention on how to use them. Salt to injury is there are two separate lock keys syymbol. One is on win key and other is on F12. F12 will lock whoel keyboard while win wil lock win. Issue is that this infomration is not clearly mentioned anywhere. just that this win key lock exists is mentioned. we got this info from customer care.6. privacy (sujective choice) - while contacting customer care they were asking about your phoen number and other details. In case you are not comfortable giving it, they never considered that option to offer unless you mnetion such which should be a default practise and unless a direct one to one communication is needed only then phone number or any other personal details shoule be sought otherwise mere email or website responses should be enough. Above all they created a new account when they simply asked us to send email about the complaints we had about product. They used our email and created an account on their website on their own without our consent and never mentioned this while giving us their email.7. N key rollover - its not on by default. it is only 6 key rolloevr out of the box and also no mention on how to activate this feature. Also even after disabling the keybaord fully(Fn+F12), although the keyboard does not input anything to system but the lighting goes haywire on the keyboard. it randomly changes to some other mode or sometimes still works with pattern changing shortcuts. It messes us our set pattern and then you need to set that again.8. Build Quality - the build quality looks fine unless you start lookign closely. The keys are not at even heights even in the same row. The keys on the same rows are at diffferent height. Just worth mentioning the keyboard profile is defaulted to contoured and yes even considering that I mention same row keys being at different heights.bugs :1. in case you lock your keyboard using Fn+F12 which is a complete keyboard lock, and post unlock your if windows key does not unlock then try pressing windows key unlock shortcut (Fn+WIN) again. Yeah its a bug where your complete keyboard lock key also locks windows implicitly but does not unlock it. We first thought that it remembers last state of the windows key lock status but it is not so. Also this is not stable, it sometimes occurs while other times it behaves normal(remembers lock state and unlocks same state).2. led patterns shortcut keys works even after full keyboard lock.3. the  windows lock key indicator does light up under the shell and peeks from other indicator light holes but does not have its own thus making it a waste as well as raises questions on quality assurance or quality checks being next to none. also the manual mentions no num lock key indicator led but it is present while mentions win lock key indicator led while it does not exist or exist but is not visible because of mismatching shell.4. random backlight pattern reset or change without any human interaction(ghosting).5. No visual indicator of keyboard lock or windows lock or unlock status."

5,¬†Itz ok best that price.also 2 extra switch swapable given.good than regear shadow blade.i buy red switch 1499rs.value for moneyüòÅüôèüôè
6,"tried typing though am not a very fast typing guy or have any job related to it,just a gamer.I was able to score 95 WPM raw-120,previously on old keyboard(membrane) 90-92.Overall build quality is ok,not so good but its ok from looks,keyboard has screw holes on top of it below buttons and the holes which are on outer side have screws installed but the holes which are at center doesnt have screws,i dont know if its me only but it is bad impression and shows quality care.its my first mechanical keyboard(red switches) and overall sound is louder than my old membrane keyboard and switches are also light.i had used cosmic byte keyboard before for more than 4 years and was still working but i thought now might be time to switch so i bought this to try a mechanical keyboard.the only complaint i have is wire is not braided but i think at this price(1750) they were not able to provide.Keyboard is compact even with full sizeu get key remover and switch remover and 2 extra switches in box and i removed a key to see if it gets any issue after replacing coz i saw in a review written it doesnt work properly after removing so i tried and interestingly it didnt happen and switches work properly still,but it got loose somewhat like if am pulling key out,half switch come out,so i suggest u to not remove it without reason.overall its great and ill update this review in future if any keys stops working or whole keyboard gets any issue,i will use this for long term like i used my previous keyboard for more than 4 years(if its not updated when you are reading this review means i didnt suffered any issue yet)"
7,"I like that they have the option of hot swappable keys. On cosmic byte official website, the keys can be bought for as low as 125rs for 20 keys. Blue/Red/Brown keys are available.So I can basically get a blue or brown keyboard by just paying around 625 more and replacing all the keys.But I think the tilt should have been more, since the keys are at more height than normal membrane keyboards. It should have come with a palm rest.What I don't like is, when I connect this to my laptop, my mic which is also connected to 3.5mm jack starts outputting static hissing noise. The level of noise depends on the level of brightness of backlight. Even with zero backlight there is some hissing. I thought the problem is with this brand, but I encountered same problem with HP GK320 mechanical keyboard. Actually the HP keyboard was louder.Cheap membrane keyboard did not exhibit this problem. I guess its because they draw less power.Apart from that I think this is a good keyboard.Now time will tell. I am hoping this would last atleast 3 years, maybe even more. Membrane keyboards don't last more than a year, and they feel good only for a month, then keys become inconsistent. First time trying a mechanical keyboard."
8,The key stroke and effort required is amazingly balanced. You will feel the confort it gives.

15,¬†The keyboard is good
16,This keyboard is so good and this is my first mechanical keyboard so i do not know if there is something that it doesn't do well that much.1. The wire quality isn't braided but thick and good quality2. The build is really good (top is metal build and the bottom is plastic build)3. The lightings look really good4. I bought the red switch and this makes good enough sound for me do i dont think i will need blue switch keyboard5. The shape and size is pretty compact for a full size keyboardOverall a really good choice.
17,Some keys (very few) don't get pressed as smoothly as they should.Overall I am happy with the keyboard.
