"This device doesnt need any review as there are tons online , but as per my experience its all rounder champ. I bought 256 gb variant. All good till now.Just bit spectacular about the software updates if apple deliberately tries to downgrade the experience and camera quality.Camera quality:I felt iphone 14 gets better result not sure why? Although both device have same camera specs , is apple doing something fishy?Battery:Is decent ,usually lasts for a day.",device doesnt need any review a there be ton online but a per my experience it all rounder champ i buy gb variant all good till now just bite spectacular about software update if apple deliberately try downgrade experience camera quality camera quality i felt iphone get well result not sure why although both device have same camera spec apple do something fishy battery decent usually last for day
"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using Samsung S10 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customization is really good and you can customize a lot of things.",my first iphone always feels good hold masterpiece look premium not just because of it branding have everything which make feel premium however despite all look finish transition from android apple not very smooth you may constantly lack certain feature can make life easy i be use samsung s10 lite before still have phone with me put out feature be miss by me 1 forward anything in whatsapp forward anything in whatsapp from iphone take bit more step a compare what be offer in android make entire process slow for android user2 app switcher apple could have easily make app switcher easy with just light swipe up instead they make with long press swipe up why man why you don t have any feature for swipe up just make easy launch 3 andorid dialer always miss every android have basic feature where you can search contact directly from phone dialer here dialer use for dial number only will not suggest you similar contact from contact or last dial really bad if you have dial number directly use dialer if you have dial someone from recent call log shift if you dial someone from contact shift man all can be do under one button under dialer android user will miss very badly 4 send multiple file in whatsapp if you want add more than file directly from whatsapp you have do twice in android one can simple start select from whatspp itself can select a many file a they want can send in single click here for send multiple file you have go gallery or folder select all file first share through whatsapp 5 no swipe base shift from chat status call in android whatsapp you can switch between call chat status by just swipe here you have press button of each 6 contact view contact list sort method still out of my mind man make easy for example if one of your contact first name or middle name or last name any one of thing start with alphabet than will be show on top of list apple pls adopt any one method or at least allow u customise 7 many apps in android be much more refined than it version on apple 8 for those who have use samsung pay samsung pay be one of best app for make upi or card payment just swipe up from home screen of samsung phone only s series app open for payment i miss here very badly 9 lack of dual messenger facility you can t use two different whatsapp number here in same phone a support in all android right now these be issue i face right now apart from phone good sound loud clear feel premium in hand touch very good face id work like charm gesture control customization really good you can customize lot of thing

I am moving from Android to ios for the first time. It is been a marvelous experience to use iPhone. I regret now for being an android user. First of all the speed what they have mentioned as lightening speed yes i have experienced the lightening speed. Anything u share in whatsapp or any app u open it opens up in a flash. When I put the phone on charging it sometimes over heat the phone but now i have identified the reason for it too. Do not use the phone When on charging leave it untouched so that it won't over heat. No sort of pauses aur hanging issues at all.,i be move from android io for first time be marvelous experience use iphone i regret now for be android user first of all speed what they have mention a lighten speed yes i have experience lighten speed anything u share in whatsapp or any app u open open up in flash when i put phone on charge sometimes over heat phone but now i have identify reason for too do not use phone when on charge leave untouched so won t over heat no sort of pause aur hang issue at all
"here's my verdict after the iOS 17.1.2 update.* horrible battery life, i end up charging twice a day* camera app freezes in when portrait mode is opened* Phone is much more laggy since the iOS 17 update.* IG reels play in the background at times, even when looking at another reel.* My battery health has dropped from 99% to 91% since the iOS 17 update.* What made the battery life worse was the magsafe charger. If you don't have it yet, don't buy it as it is a  slow charger (for overnight charging) and generates a lot of heat when charging, i ended up buying an  aluminium stand so that the heat would dissipate through the stand.If a company forces you to buy several other products for the customer to use it for its intended purpose, then please choose another device.Westerners don't have to worry about it as they have apple care + clubbed into their purchase in the form of an EMI. Plus , they have theft protection with their apple care + which is not available for the iPhones sold in India.Do not buy an iPhone if its just a status symbol for you, buy it if it suits your needs.",here s my verdict after io 1 2 update horrible battery life i end up charge twice day camera app freeze in when portrait mode open phone much more laggy since io update ig reel play in background at time even when look at another reel my battery health have drop from since io update what make battery life worse be magsafe charger if you don t have yet don t buy a slow charger for overnight charge generates lot of heat when charge i end up buy aluminium stand so heat would dissipate through stand if company force you buy several other product for customer use for it intend purpose then please choose another device westerner don t have worry about a they have apple care club into their purchase in form of emi plus they have theft protection with their apple care which not available for iphones sell in india do not buy iphone if it just status symbol for you buy if suit your need
